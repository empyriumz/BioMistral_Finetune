    Returns the possible permutation matrix label for the given events and durations.

    For a right-censored sample `i`, we only know that the risk must be lower than the risk of all other
    samples with an event time lower than the censoring time of `i`, i.e. they must be ranked after
    these events. We can thus assign p=0 of sample `i` being ranked before any prior events, and uniform
    probability that it has a higher ranking.

    For another sample `j` with an event at `t_j`, we know that the risk must be lower than the risk of
    other samples with an event time lower than `t_j`, and higher than the risk of other samples either
    with an event time higher than `t_j` or with a censoring time higher than `t_j`. We do not know how
    the risk compares to samples with censoring time lower than `t_j`, and thus have to assign uniform
    probability to their rankings.
